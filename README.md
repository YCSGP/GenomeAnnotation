# GenomeAnnotation

This repository provides annotation resources and tools for **genome annotation**, specifically focusing on three annotation methods: **GenoCanyon**, **GenoSkyline**, and **GenoSkyline-Plus**.

## Overview
### GenoCanyon
**GenoCanyon** is a statistical framework to predict functional non-coding regions in the human genome through integrated analysis of genomic conservation measures and biochemical annotations.

### GenoSkyline
**GenoSkyline** is a principled framework to predict tissue-specific functional regions through integrating high-throughput epigenomic annotations.

### GenoSkyline-Plus
**GenoSkyline-Plus** is a comprehensive update of GenoSkyline that incorporates more annotation data into the framework and extends to 127 integrated annotation tracks covering a spectrum of human tissue and cell types.
